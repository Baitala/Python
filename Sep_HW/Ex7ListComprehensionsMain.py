# Letâ€™s say I give you a list saved in a variable: a = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49
# , 64, 81, 100]. Write one line of Python that takes this list a and makes a 
# new list that has only the even elements of this list in it.

# Compare to this piece of code:

#   years_of_birth = [1990, 1991, 1990, 1990, 1992, 1991]
#   ages = [2014 - year for year in years_of_birth]
