# Take two lists, say for example these two:

# 	a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
# 	b = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]

# and write a program that returns a list that contains only the elements that
# are common between the lists (without duplicates). Make sure your program 
# works on two lists of different sizes. Write this in one line of Python using
# at least one list comprehension.
# 
# Extra:

#   Randomly generate two lists to test this
